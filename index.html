        <p>
            After graduating from Rutgers University with a B.S. and M.A. in Criminal Justice, I decided to pursue avenues in web development.
            I enjoyed researching and dissecting the conceptual ideas of roles and boundaries that individiuals create when commiting crimes.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
              However, after graduating from college I realized that it was difficult to find a job with my degree and my interest in qualitative research died down. But one day I got into
              contact with a relative who had gotten her feet wet in the tech world. She seemed to really enjoy her work and gave me plenty of tools to start learning about computer science.
              After grappling with JavaScript and Ruby on my own for 2 months I decided to attend Rutgers Coding Bootcamp to get a stronger grasp
              on coding with Node, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Some other things that enjoy doing is drawing and designing with doodles and continous line art. I hope to further my skills as a front end developer so that I can intertwine my hobbies with web development.
            I hope to one day create web page that has a seamless and slick interface for clients to enjoy.
